For example, 2 + 3 = 5.\n\n* Subtraction: Subtracting one number from another using the '-' operator. For example, 5 - 3 = 2.\n\n* Multiplication: Multiplying two numbers together using the '*' operator. For example, 2 * 3 = 6.\n\n* Division: Dividing one number by another using the '/' operator. For example, 6 / 3 = 2.\n\n* Modulo: Finding the remainder of a division using the '%' operator. For example, 7 % 3 = 1.\n\n* Exponentiation: Raising a number to a power using the '**' operator.
